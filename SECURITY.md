## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you are indeed finding a security vulnerability, please head to our [Security Advisory Page](https://github.com/marpme/next-testing/security/advisories).
On this page you are able to `Report a vulnerabilty` or directly click [here](https://github.com/marpme/next-testing/security/advisories/new) to create a new report.

Due to the nature of open source, I try my best to respond within one day after reporting this issue.
I'm more than happy to support critical changes if really necessary.
